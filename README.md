# MemoryApp

Memory App is a small memory allocation application, a visual way of showing memory allocation and how data fits within it.

Written with the help of Raylib and Raygui, raylib  and raygui header files can be found in the include folder and the libraries to link to can be found in lib. 

When building and running you will need the raylib dll in the build folder to run the project.

Tested with:
visual studio 2019
visual studio 2022
 
 Allows the user to:
* Allocate virtual memory up to MAX_MEMORY
* drag and drop files into the window to load them into memory and visulise how much space they are taking up
* delete blocks of memory or clear all the currently allocated memory.
* clicking on an image or audio block will try to load the file and show/play if supported by raylib
